                <p class="p">Koyamaki Ventures is a crypto-focused venture capital firm founded in 2022 and named after the Japanese umbrella-pine. Our investment thesis is simple - invest in anything under the crypto umbrella with a strong team, idea, and market fit. We believe the space is ushering in a significant paradigm shift in finance, web applications, and, most notably, how humans organize themselves in a digital world.</p>
                <p class="p">The partners have diverse backgrounds in computer science, economics, game theory, and law, and have been involved in the crypto industry for over 10 years. Daniel graduated from MIT and was a software engineer for 5 years before joining the fund. Will studied physics and law, and graduated from UF law school in 2019. Stephen dropped out of college in order to pursue trading and investing.</p>
                <p class="p">Two-thirds of our team currently lives in Latin America, which gives us a significant advantage in understanding this growing region, but we travel and invest around the world.</p>
